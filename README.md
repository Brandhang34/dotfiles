# My Dot files
These are my current dotfiles and configurations for my terminal. I am running on Fedora so some of the set alias 
in the .zshrc file could be different depending on the operating systems.

## Terminal Tooling:
- [helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix) : Text editor
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) : Terminal Multiplexer
- [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide) : Smart change directory
- [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) : Better version of cat
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) : recursive search tool
- [eza](https://github.com/eza-community/eza) : ls with colors and icons
- [gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum) : Tool for shell scripts
- [starship](https://github.com/starship/starship) : Nice looking shell prompt
- [ohmyzsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) : bash but with plugins
